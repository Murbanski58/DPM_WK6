        <p>Maggie is an organized, hard-working individual that can be trusted to get the job done! She is always 
        willing to be a team player and work collectively with all individuals to get the job done. She easily 
        connects with co-workers, creating a healthy environment where everyone feels welcome. I am lucky to have 
        been able to work side by side Maggie.

        I was responsible for training Maggie during these past few months and she has come as far to train new Inventory
        Control Specialists hersels. She has never once complained and actively seeks out hard work. Maggie has become
        our regions and vendors "go-to" individual for a quick response as well. She has unrivaled work ethic and will go
        far with whatever she persues. Her accomplishments during her intenship have been outstanding. It will be hard for 
        the team to reabsorb the responsabilities that Maggie has taken on, but I know we are all excited for her to return
        home.
