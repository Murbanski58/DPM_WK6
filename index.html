        <h2> About Maggie </h2> <img src="./photos/Maggie.jpg" width="300" alt= "Photo of Maggie">
        <p> I am a senior at the University of Iowa studying Business Analytics and Information Systems planning
            to graduate in December of 2023. I am open to any opportunities to put my teamwork skills to work 
            and positively contribute to the success of a business. 

            The courses that the University of Iowa offers have grown my communication, leadership, 
            and creativity skills as well as introducing me to new ways of thinking. Through these courses, 
            I have gained a proficient background in Microsoft Applications, SQL, and R.

        <p>
            I am a reliable and thoughtful employee who can be trusted to complete tasks and assist coworkers. 
            My extensive customer service background from working at Costco Wholesale and the Voxman Music Building
            have equipped me with strong written and verbal communication skills as well as problem-solving skills.
            My detail-oriented nature combined with a passion for learning makes me a driven and diligent worker.
        </p>
